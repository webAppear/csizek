  <p> Welcome to my personal site where you can find out a little bit about me and my interests. Please use the links below to explore the pages in this file.</p>
  <p>Open a word processor application, such as Microsoft Word, or Text Edit or Notepad
    and write a few sentence for each page. You will need some text content for each of
    these pages:
    1. The home page, introducing yourself
    2. The where you live page – Something about where you live
    3. The what you do page – Something about what you do. If you are a full time
    student, it can be something about that.
    4. The main interests page – Something that describes your interests in general
    5. A page for each of three interests – Something about each individual interest
    or hobby.</p>
